STEP E:
Commands:
git branch feature-1
git checkout feature-1
cd hwk4

Output:
* feature-1
  main
/Users/mey/Desktop/softhw/soft2101-homework4/hwk4
homework4.txt


STEP F:
Commands:
git checkout feature-1
mkdir -p hmk1
cd hmk1
nano Main.java
javac Main.java
java Main

Program Output:

Commit:
git add hmk1/Main.java
git commit -m "satisfying requirement one"
git push origin feature-1

Explanation:
A new Java program was created in a separate branch (feature-1) to satisfy the first project requirement.
The program was successfully compiled and executed, and its output was verified.
The change was committed and pushed to the remote feature branch.

QUESTION:
What are all the commits you’ve made on the feature-1 branch?

Answer:
fabb6c6 satisfying requirement one
e9e05a3 Add STEP F solution
c2ec8d8 Add STEP F question answers

What files (and sub-directories, if any) are listed in your hmk1 directory on the feature-1 branch?

Answer:
Main.java

What files (and sub-directories, if any) are listed in your hmk1 directory on the main branch?

Answer:
None. The hmk1 directory does not exist on the main branch.


STEP G:

Command:
git checkout main
git pull

Result:
The feature-1 branch was successfully merged into main.
The main branch now contains hmk1/Main.java and the STEP F documentation.


STEP H:

Commands:
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature-2
git branch

Output:
* feature-2
  feature-1
  main


STEP I: Create feature-3 branch from main

Commands:
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature-3
git branch
git checkout main

Output:
* feature-3
  feature-2
  feature-1
  main

Explanation:
The feature-3 branch was created from the main branch using the command
`git checkout -b feature-3`. After creation, the working branch was switched
back to main in order to continue development safely.


STEP J:

Commands:
git checkout feature-2
nano hmk1/Main.java
javac hmk1/Main.java
java -cp hmk1 Main
git add hmk1/Main.java
git commit -m "satisfying requirement change two"
git push origin feature-2

Program Output:
5
7

Explanation:
The existing method was modified so that it prints only the odd numbers in the given range.
The change was committed on the feature-2 branch with the required commit message.

QUESTION:
What are all the commits you’ve made on the feature-2 branch?

Answer:
5e476d4 satisfying requirement change two
